## 2. Short Overview

This project analyzes a dataset of the most streamed songs, showcasing audio and behavioral indicators (such as BPM, danceability, energy) along with distribution across platforms (Spotify, Apple, Deezer, Shazam), release information, and number of artists. The final report is prepared in Power BI (`Spotify.pbix`) and the dashboard design was completed in Figma.

## 7. Power BI & Figma Files

* Power BI report file: `Spotify.pbix`
* Figma design: link or export available upon request

---

## 8. Methodology Summary

* Data cleaning: handling missing values and standardizing column names
* Date transformations: extracting year/month/day from release date fields
* Calculations: platform appearance counts, averages, and correlations
* Visualizations: dashboards in Power BI (overview, audio features, platform comparison, time series)

---

## 9. Limitations

* Column types may require manual correction (text vs numeric)
* If the PBIX uses live connections, reproducing the report may require the same environment

---

## 10. Suggested Deliverables

* Export the Power BI report as a multi-page PDF for presentation
* Prepare a PowerPoint with screenshots and explanations
* Add a one-page executive summary (English/Arabic)
